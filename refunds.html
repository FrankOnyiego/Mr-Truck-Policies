    <h2>1. Scope</h2>

    <h2>2. Eligible Grounds for Refunds</h2>
    <p>You may be eligible for a full or partial refund under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service not provided</strong> – If a Driver fails to arrive or does not complete the agreed service.</li>
      <li><strong>Duplicate charge or payment error</strong> – If you were charged twice or experienced a technical payment issue.</li>
      <li><strong>Materially different service</strong> – If the service delivered is substantially different from what was agreed.</li>
      <li><strong>Damaged goods (where applicable)</strong> – For delivery-related services where goods arrive damaged due to the Driver’s fault (subject to evidence).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Exclusions</h2>
    <p>Refunds will not be issued under the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cancellations made outside the free-cancellation window stated in the app.</li>
      <li>Change-of-mind after a service has already been completed.</li>
      <li>Disputes relating to goods transported where the Driver demonstrates that the agreed service was performed correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>Refund requests must be submitted within <strong>7 days</strong> of the booking by either:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>5. Review Process</h2>
    <p>Once a refund request is received:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We will acknowledge your request within <strong>48 hours</strong>.</li>
      <li>We may contact you or the Driver to verify details.</li>
      <li>We aim to complete investigations and provide a resolution within <strong>7–14 business days</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Refund Method</h2>
    <p>If approved, refunds will be processed back to your original payment method. Processing times may vary depending on your bank or payment provider.</p>

    <h2>7. Partial Refunds</h2>
    <p>Where applicable, partial refunds may be issued for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Late arrival by the Driver</li>
      <li>Partially completed service</li>
      <li>Mutually agreed adjustments between Customer and Driver</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Consumer Rights</h2>
    <p>This Refunds Policy does not limit your legal rights under the <strong>Kenya Consumer Protection Act</strong> or other applicable laws. Where statutory rights apply, they will prevail in addition to this Policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Chargebacks & Disputes</h2>
    <p>If you dispute a charge with your payment provider, we will cooperate with their investigation. If their decision is in our favour, we reserve the right to recover disputed amounts directly from you.</p>
