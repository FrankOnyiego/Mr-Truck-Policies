  <!-- Terms of Service -->
  <div id="tos" class="policy-section">
    <h2>Terms of Service (TOS) — Mr Truck</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
      These Terms govern your access to and use of the Mr Truck mobile application and related services (the “Service”) provided by <strong>BSC Limited</strong> (“Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”). By using the Service you agree to these Terms.</li>

      <li><strong>Eligibility</strong><br>
      You must be at least 18 years old and legally capable of forming binding contracts under Kenyan law. You must provide accurate details during registration.</li>

      <li><strong>Account & Registration</strong><br>
      Users may register as Customers or Drivers. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account.</li>

      <li><strong>Nature of Service</strong><br>
      Mr Truck connects Customers with independent Drivers/Carriers. A booking accepted by a Driver forms a direct contract between Customer and Driver. Unless expressly stated, the Company does not provide transportation services itself.</li>

      <li><strong>Goods in Transit & Insurance</strong><br>
      Customers are encouraged to obtain Goods in Transit (GIT) insurance for valuable or fragile items. Risk of loss transfers once goods are handed to the Driver. The Company is not liable for loss, theft, or damage unless caused by gross negligence.</li>

      <li><strong>Fees & Payments</strong><br>
      Fees and applicable taxes are displayed in-app. Payments are processed securely via third-party providers. By booking, you authorise charges to your payment method.</li>

      <li><strong>Cancellations & Refunds</strong><br>
      Refunds and cancellations are governed by our <a href="#refunds">Refunds Policy</a>.</li>

      <li><strong>User Obligations</strong><br>
      You agree not to: provide false information; use the Service unlawfully; transport illegal or hazardous items (e.g., drugs, weapons); or interfere with system security.</li>

      <li><strong>Intellectual Property</strong><br>
      All app content, trademarks, and software belong to BSC Limited. You may not copy, distribute, or exploit them without written consent.</li>

      <li><strong>Liability</strong><br>
      Our liability for direct losses is capped at the booking fee. We are not liable for indirect or consequential loss. Nothing limits liability for death or injury caused by negligence.</li>

      <li><strong>Suspension & Termination</strong><br>
      We may suspend or terminate accounts for fraud, breach of Terms, or unlawful conduct.</li>

      <li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong><br>
      These Terms are governed by Kenyan law. Disputes will first be resolved amicably, failing which they shall be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration Act (1995).</li>
